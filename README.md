## The Effect of Music Listening on EEG Functional Connectivity of Brain
Music is a very good stimulus, and it appears to have a cognitive and emotional status, in contrast to others. Music has a powerful effect on the brain; it can regulate mood by enhancing joy and happiness, as well as enhance vigilance. Music can make you feel better, more joyful, and relaxed, but it can also be bothersome and aggravating, leading to stress, hypertension, and impairment of cognitive processes.

EEG data are brain waves that may be separated into several frequency bands. Each of these bands is linked to a certain function in the brain. The brain frequency bands are classified into five groups, according to and the International Federation of Clinical Physiology for Clinical Neurophysiology, as follows:

Alpha activity (α waves): are found in practically every portion of the brain, but predominantly in the occipital lobe, and have a frequency of 8-12 Hz. These waves are strongly related with any feeling of relaxation. Alpha waves are frequently increased during meditation or other stress-relieving activities.

Beta activity (β wave): Beta waves, or brain waves with frequencies ranging from 12 to 30 Hz, indicate an active brain state . These waves arise when performing everyday chores in a normal state of awareness. Low beta waves are observed when we engage in shallow thinking, whereas high beta waves are observed when we are fully focused and competent in tasks that require understanding. As a result, beta activity (wave) is connected to the brain state during cognitive and conscious action .

Theta activity (θ wave): Created during sleep and drowsiness theta waves have a frequency of 4–8 Hz. Theta waves, which are the fastest brain waves, are present in situations involving high degrees of spiritual consciousness and in experiences that elicit higher virtues like love, empathy, and kindness. In this mode, people are at ease, and different ideas flow more easily.

Delta (δ) waves, the slowest brain waves with a frequency range of 0.5 - 4 Hz, are not seen in adult brains while awake. They are more commonly connected with deep sleep and disorders like as hypoxia and schizophrenia. Delta activity (wave) on the other hand is related with the deepest depths of sleep and meditation and has been shown to benefit brain repair and recovery.

Gamma activity (γ wave): are the fastest brain waves, with frequencies greater than 30 Hz. They are linked to better cognitive function, memory, and attention. When a person is deeply concentrating and addressing issues, gamma waves are seen. These waves can also be seen in stroke and epilepsy patients.

### Data Description
The dataset supplied includes electroencephalography (EEG) responses from 20 Indian subjects. The reactions were captured while they were listening to 12 various songs ranging from Indian classical to goth rock. The song number to which each participant listened was labeled on their session. After hearing a single beep, which signaled that the music was about to start, the subjects were told to close their eyes as part of the experiment. The music was then played via speakers, and participants were asked to score their familiarity and enjoyment of the song. They were instructed to open their eyes and rate the situation on a scale of 1 to 5. This was accomplished by giving them a double beep. Using a scale of 1 to 5, the ratings were tallied, with 1 denoting the song as being the most well-known or enjoyable and 5 denoting the opposite. The events chronology in the segmented data should be ignored because it is inherited from the raw data.

### Data pre-processing
The subjects' EEG data were pre-processed using a Python script written with the MNE (MNE-Python) toolkit. Several stages were required in the script to prepare the data for analysis and extract key characteristics. The following is a summary of the pre-processing steps. The required libraries, including MNE, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, and seaborn, were imported to facilitate data analysis and visualization. Participant IDs and session names were defined to identify and organize the EEG data for each participant and session. The raw EEG data for each participant and session were loaded. The data were then stored in a dictionary for easy access and further processing. Specific frequency bands of interest, such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma, were defined based on their relevance to the study.
After the application of data pre-processing, you can see some sample EEG images below.

### Results and Discussion
To interpret the plots, we will analyze the patterns and changes in power across different frequency bands during sessions. In Session 4, participants listened the song 'Aurore - Claire David'. It is classified as New Age and has a duration of 111 seconds. In Session 4, the average power across participants was plotted for different frequency bands. Gamma waves exhibited fluctuating patterns throughout the session. Initially, between 0 to 40 ms, they reached very high power values. However, they decreased afterward. Towards the end of the session, the gamma power increased again. These fluctuations in gamma power suggest varying levels of high-frequency neural activity during different time intervals. Theta, Beta, Alpha, and Delta Waves: These frequency bands generally exhibited power levels close to zero during the session. However, there was a notable increase and subsequent decrease observed between 100-120 ms. This transient increase in power suggests a momentary enhancement of neural activity within these frequency bands during that specific time window. Overall, the results indicate dynamic changes in the power of gamma waves throughout the session, with pronounced increases and decreases. On the other hand, theta, beta, alpha, and delta waves primarily remained at lower power levels, but with brief increments and decrements during a specific time interval. These findings provide insights into the temporal dynamics and fluctuations of neural oscillations in different frequency bands during Session 4.

In Session 11, participants listened the song "Master of Running - Rickeyabo". It is classified as Goth Rock and has a duration of 113 seconds with a tempo of 120 bpm. During the session, we looked for any noticeable fluctuations in power within the delta band (0.5-4 Hz). As can be seen from the plot, there is a rise in delta power between approximately 40 and 45 ms, followed by a reduction to 50 ms. This demonstrates a slight increase in delta power during that period. It's worth noting that delta waves are frequently associated with deep sleep or unconscious states. Consequently, an increase in delta power may indicate a more relaxed or restful state. Then we examined for variations in power within the beta band (13-30 Hz). According to the graph, beta power increases and decreases at the same time as delta waves but to a lesser extent. This suggests that there may be a link between changes in delta and beta waves, possibly reflecting different aspects of brain activity during the session. If we look for any changes in power within the theta band (4-8 Hz), theta power follows a similar pattern to delta and beta waves, i.e., it increases and decreases at the same time but to a lesser extent. This further supports the notion of correlated activity across multiple frequency bands. When the power changes within the alpha band (8-13 Hz) are examined, alpha power also shows a similar pattern to delta and beta waves, which reinforces the idea of concurrent fluctuations in multiple frequency bands during the session. Finally, power changes in the Gamma band (30-100 Hz) were assessed. The gamma power fluctuates without a clear pattern, it suggests that the gamma oscillations may be independent of the observed changes in the delta, beta, theta, and alpha bands. Gamma waves are often associated with higher cognitive functions and sensory processing.

The investigation goes beyond Session 4 and Session 11, since several additional sessions were also studied. Throughout these sessions, it became clear that music had the ability to consistently impact our brain waves. The overall trend indicates that music has the ability to generate unique patterns of brain activity across several frequency ranges. The oscillations in gamma, delta, theta, alpha, and beta waves detected over the many sessions demonstrate the dynamic nature of our brain's reaction to music. These variations imply that various songs, regardless of genre, have the ability to evoke distinct brain reactions. Music might possibly provoke numerous emotional states, alter our mood, and increase cognitive functions by adjusting the power within specific frequency regions.

These findings highlight the complex interaction between music and the human brain. Music is a potent stimulus that may influence our neurophysiological reactions in real time. The potential of music to influence our brain waves brings up fascinating therapeutic possibilities, such as using certain songs or genres to elicit desired emotional states or enhance cognitive functions.
